## Week 7

### Introduction

Last week was deterministic image restoration. This week is stochastic image
restoration (uses probability).

### Wiener restoration filter

We assume the image is a sample of a random field.

### Weiner vs. CLS restoration filter

With Weiner, instead of measuring the image and noise power spectra from the
available noise image, we model them instead.

### Weiner noise smoothing filter

### Maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimation

### Bayesian restoration algorithms

We are interested in obtaining an estimate of the posterior, not just its maximum value.
