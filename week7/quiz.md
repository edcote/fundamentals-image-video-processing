1. Which of the following options is not considered a stochastic restoration
approach?

Answer: Constrained least-squares filter

2. Which of the following describes the "orthogonality principle" of Wiener
filter? Let f(i,j), y(i,j), and ^f(i,j) denote the original, degraded, and
restored signal, respectively.

Answer: Not A or B. ???

3. In general, the constrained least-squares restoration filter has better
performance than the Wiener restoration filter.

Answer: False

4. In the Bayesian formulation, if p(f) denotes the image prior distribution,
p(y∣f) denotes the likelihood, where y denotes the noisy and blurred image,
then p(f∣y) denotes

Answer:

(C) the posterior distribution

5. Which of the following statements about the Bayesian formulation of image
restoration is (are) correct? Check all that apply.

Answer: ???

| | Noise must have Gaussian distribution

| | Maximum likelihood estimation maximizes the posterior distribution
