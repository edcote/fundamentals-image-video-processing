# Week 8 Quiz

1. It is impossible to compress a signal without compromising its integrity.

Answer: False

2. Signal compression is achieved due to the reduction in which of the
following forms of redundancy? Check all that apply.

|x| Temporal redundancy in signals

|x| Perceptual redundancy in signals (i.e., the presence of perceptually irrelevant information in signals)

|x| Coding redundancy (i.e., the inefficient use of bits in representing signals)

|x| Spatial redundancy in signals

|x| Spectral redundancy in signals

3.  It is given that a discrete memoryless source (DMS) has alphabet S={a,b,c}
with associated probabilities p(a)=0.2, p(b)=0.5 and p(c)=0.3.  If the first
two symbols emitted by the source are a and c what is the probability of having
b emitted by the source as the third symbol?

Answer: 0.5

4. Given that a discrete memoryless source (DMS) with alphabet S={a,b,c}
and associated probabilities p(a)=0.2, p(b)=0.5 and p(c)=0.3, , what is the
entropy of this source in unit of bits? Enter the answer to 3 decimal points.

`0.3*log2(0.3) + 0.2*log2(0.2) + 0.5*log2(0.5)`

Answer: 1.485

5. For a DMS with alphabet {a,b,c,d} and associated probabilities p(a)=0.6,
p(b)=0.3, p(c)=0.08, and p(d)=0.02, we want to design a Huffman code. In this
design, when the two symbols with the lowest probabilities are combined to form
a new symbol, 0 is assigned to the symbol of the two with higher probability.
For example, in the initial stage, the two symbols with the lowest
probabilities are c with p(c)=0.08 and p(d)=0.02. When c and d are combined, 0
is assigned to c, and 1 is assigned to d. When the encoding is complete, which
of the following is the codeword assigned to c?

Answer:

6. Assume a DMS with alphabet {a,b,c} and associated probabilities p(a)=0.5,
p(b)=0.3, and p(c)=0.2. A sequence of length 4 is encoded using arithmetic
coding, and the encoded number (the tag) is equal to  0.386. In the encoding
process, the following limits are used Fx(1)=0.5, Fx(2)=0.8, and Fx(3)=1. Based
on this information, which of the following is the encoded 4-symbol sequence

Answer:
